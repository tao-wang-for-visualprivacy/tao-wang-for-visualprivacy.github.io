# üßê About Me

Hi there! I am a  PhD student majoring in Cyberspace Security at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, under the supervision of Prof. [Yushu Zhang](https://yushuzhang.cn/).
<!--I completed my master's degree in [Software Engineering at Zhejiang University](http://www.cst.zju.edu.cn/cstenglish/main.htm) in March 2023, advised by Prof. [Chao Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=gpTPt58AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Hainan University in July 2020. -->

<!-- Previously, I interned at Sony AI for half a year, focusing on AI security and model compression. Before that, I also interned at Tencent Youtu Lab for one year, exploring federated learning and adversarial attacks. -->

### **Research Interests**: 
<!--  I am mainly interested in data-centric AI or data-driven machine learning, including data privacy, data security, data efficiency, and data-related applications. My research investigates how to elevate data-centric approaches to improving the performance of machine learning models. Previously, I focused on the following research topics:
- Data Efficiency: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation, Dataset Condensation
- Data Security: Adversarial Examples, Model Inversion
- Data Privacy: Membership Inference Attack
- Data-related Applications: Federated Learning, Imbalanced Learning, Continual Learning
 -->


ü§î For my PhD study,  my primary focus is on <font color="red">human-centered visual privacy protection</font>.  Specifically, I aim to design practical tools that address privacy concerns in real-world applications, such as social scenarios, where users often face significant privacy risks. By combining theoretical research with practical implementation, I hope to develop solutions that are not only effective but also user-friendly and widely adoptable.
